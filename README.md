# NFL_DB

This is a personal SQL Server Project I created using all real NFL players, teams, and colleges. I hope to grow the database into yearly stats, draft picks, and get an ERD set up at some point. 

I am still in initial stage of setting up seeds. Once all seeds are input correctly, Views and Procedures will be created at which point I will create a more in-depth README so that you can interact with the database.
